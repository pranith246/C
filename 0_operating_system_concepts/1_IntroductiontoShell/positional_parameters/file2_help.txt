This is the help file for using positional parameters.
Step 1:
Make a shell script that renames a given file to file.[username]
script.sh
- name=$1  //name variable takes first argument when script is run and puts it in name. first argument is essentially the name of file to be renamed.
- set `who am i` //sets the positional parameters to output of whoami. Note it is not ' but `.
- mv $name $name.$1 // move contents of file given in argument while running the script to [original_filename].[username]

Step 2:
Execute the shell script
- chmod 700 script.sh
- sh script.sh 
- ./script.sh [filename]
